Let's start by asking the most important question; why should I even use Fastspring?
If you're like me, you probably have the following headache (or you will in the near future):

> How do I deal with paying taxes on my digital sales?

There's two options here:

1. Register to pay taxes in all countries you'd like to sell digital products in
1. Use a Merchant-of-Record to take care of taxes for you

The latter approach being much more reasonable unless you're a international mega-corp. And so the next question will naturally be:

> Which Merchant-of-Record provider is the best for me?

With all the options out there today, there are in my opinion 2 solid contenders to evaluate as of today:

* [Paddle](https://paddle.com/)
* [Fastspring](https://fastspring.com/)

While Paddle is arguably the more developer friendly of the two, it has several drawbacks which meant that for my online stores so far, it would not be beneficial:

1. Paddle does not have a real cart solution where you can add multiple products to the cart
    - Might be worth mentioning that you can "hack" together a cart on your own, but this would require more server-side logic & maintenance
1. Paddle does have a coupon system, but only when buying single products, not when hacking together your own cart system
1. Paddle does not offer the ability to up-sell to bundles of products

So that leaves Fastspring, which gives us all of this, and more!

The one thing lacking is an opinionated A-Z guide to actually get this implemented, so that's why you're here!
